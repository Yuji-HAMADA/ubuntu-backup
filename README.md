# Ubuntu Backup

This repository contains a backup of the system configuration for a machine running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.

## Backup Contents

*   `packages.list`: A list of installed apt packages, generated by `dpkg --get-selections`.
*   `snap-packages.txt`: A list of installed snap packages, generated by `snap list`.
*   `system-info.txt`: Information about the system, including OS version and kernel.
*   `custom-scripts/`: Contains custom scripts.
*   `systemd/`: Contains custom systemd service files.
*   `vnc/`: Contains VNC configuration files.

## Backup and Restore

There are two scripts to help with the backup and restore process:

*   `backup.sh`: This script updates the package lists and system information files.
*   `restore.sh`: This script restores the packages listed in `packages.list` and `snap-packages.txt`.

### How to Backup

To update the backup, simply run the `backup.sh` script:

```bash
./backup.sh
```

### How to Restore

To restore from the backup, run the `restore.sh` script:

```bash
./restore.sh
```

**Note:** The restore script needs to be run with `sudo` privileges.

## VNC Setup

The `systemd/vnc-custom.service` file is provided to automatically start a VNC server on boot. To enable it, you would typically run:

```bash
sudo cp systemd/vnc-custom.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable vnc-custom.service
sudo systemctl start vnc-custom.service
```

**Note:** The `vnc-custom.service` file contains a hardcoded PID file path that may not be portable across different machines. You may need to adjust it for your specific setup.
